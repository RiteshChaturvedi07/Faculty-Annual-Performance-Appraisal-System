To run this project locally on your machine, you need a development environment that can transpile TypeScript and React (JSX), as browsers cannot execute .tsx files natively. I recommend using Vite, which is the industry standard for fast modern frontend development.
Prerequisites
Node.js (Version 18 or higher) installed on your computer.
Setup Instructions
Create a Project Folder: Create a new directory on your computer (e.g., faculty-appraisal).
Save the Files: Copy and save all the files provided (including the new package.json and vite.config.ts below) into that root folder.
Install Dependencies:
Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:
code
Bash

      npm install

Start the Development Server:
Run the following command to start the app:
code
Bash

      npm run dev

View the App: Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
